subtitle: The dreamers behind PasarGad Studio
---

<p>We are a small, independent collective of storytellers, designers, and programmers who grew up loving both ancient myths and modern games. PasarGad Studio is our way of weaving those influences together.</p>

<p>Our focus is on tight, human stories, carefully crafted worlds, and mechanics that support emotion instead of fighting it. As the studio grows, this page will introduce each member of the team.</p>
