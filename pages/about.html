<p>PasarGad Studio is a small dreamer team in love with creativity and narrative design. We build atmospheric, story-first games inspired by the stones, skies, and silences of Pasargad in Persia.</p>

<p>Every project is a new expedition into choices, consequences, and the value of humanity. We care about mood, detail, and the feeling that a world keeps breathing even when the screen is dark.</p>
